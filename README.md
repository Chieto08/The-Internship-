# The Internship

**I am grateful for this oportunity to intern with one of the bests I have come across in the field of Computer Sciences, and more grateful that I have been given the opportunity to state what I would like to achieve at the end of this internship.**

---
### Below are the skills which i will like to achieve:
### *Ability to work in a team.*
Working in a team is an important skill for most companies, it is therefore something most employers would frown upon if a candidate lacks such. Not just working in a team will i like to achieve in this aspect but also, writing good programs that would makes the work of other team members easier, or at least not more difficult.

### *Experience of working in an organization.*
I have been involved in several personal projects, but working in an organization has a different experience which I would like to have, this which would also include writing clean codes, delivering projects on-time, writing re-usable programs and implementing the major software development techniques.

### *Gain of a problem solving skill*
One major thing I would like to achieve at the end of this internship is to gain a problem solving skill. That is, I hope that at the end of this internship, I am able to reason better and faster when faced with a problem and therefore provide if not the optimal solution for a problem, a solution close to being an optimal solution in a shorter time span.

### *Good communication skills*
A good communication skill is very important and therefore I would like to use this opportunity to achieve that. At the end of this internship I hope to be the best communicator I can, including being formal where neccessary and where not.

# Thank You!
